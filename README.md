This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  lack of error handling for invalid input.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, which fails to handle cases where the user ID is not a valid integer. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with proper error handling, preventing crashes and providing informative error messages.
